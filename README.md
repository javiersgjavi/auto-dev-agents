# Auto Dev Agents

This project showcases a basic **CrewAI** setup for automating code generation. The agents take the high-level requirements described in `prompt.yaml` and coordinate the design, implementation and testing of a small Python project.

## Agents and tasks

Four specialized agents collaborate on this project:

- **Engineering Lead** – prepares a detailed design for the module based on the high-level requirements.
- **Backend Engineer** – implements the Python module described in the design.
- **Frontend Engineer** – provides a simple Gradio interface demonstrating the backend.
- **Test Engineer** – writes unit tests for the generated module.

They execute the following tasks in order:

1. **design_task** – produces a Markdown design document outlining classes and functions.
2. **code_task** – generates the backend module implementing the design.
3. **frontend_task** – creates a minimal Gradio app showcasing the backend.
4. **test_task** – generates automated tests for the backend module.

## Repository structure

```
auto-dev-agents/
├── prompt.yaml                  # Project requirements and module/class names
├── pyproject.toml               # Packaging configuration
├── uv.lock                      # Dependency lock file for uv
└── src/
    └── auto_dev_agents/
        ├── crew.py              # Crew and task definitions
        ├── main.py              # Entry point used by the crewai CLI
        └── config/
            ├── agents.yaml      # Description of each agent
            └── tasks.yaml       # Description of the tasks
```

The `output/` directory will be created when running the crew and will contain the design, generated code and tests.

## Dependency management

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage its Python dependencies. The locked requirements are stored in `uv.lock`.

## Setup

1. **Install `uv`**

   ```bash
   curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install | sh
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and the CrewAI CLI**

   ```bash
   uv pip install crewai[tools]
   uv tool install crewai
   ```

4. **Run the crew**

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

   The crew relies on Docker to safely execute code generated by the agents.

## Prompt configuration

The file `prompt.yaml` defines the project requirements the crew will work on. Edit it to request something different:

```yaml
requirements: |
  Describe here your idea or the functionality you want to implement.
module_name: "my_module.py"
class_name: "MyClass"
```

Changing those values will alter the generated module, class and files.

When you are happy with the prompt, run `crewai run` again to generate the new code and tests inside the `output/` folder.


## Advanced customization

You can modify `agents.yaml` to change the agent profiles or `tasks.yaml` to adjust the workflow. Each agent focuses on a specific phase (design, backend, frontend and tests) but you can add or remove any as needed.
