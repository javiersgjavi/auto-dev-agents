requirements: |
  A simple membership management system for a gym.
  The system should allow users to:
    - Register a new member with their name and membership type (e.g., "basic", "premium").
    - Check in a member when they arrive at the gym (only if their membership is active).
    - Cancel a membership.
    - View a member's current status (active or cancelled).
    - View a log of all check-ins per member, including timestamps.
  The system should ensure:
    - A cancelled member cannot check in.
    - All check-ins are timestamped and associated with the correct member.
  The system must be implemented as a single Python module.
  The module will be named {module_name} and must contain a single class named {class_name}.
module_name: "gym_membership.py"
class_name: "GymMembership"
